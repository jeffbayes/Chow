##Notes

###Thoughts for Meeting 5/12/14
Search bar capabilities: if searching for a specific restaurant, then toggle "restaurant." If searching dishes, can we load all menus of
all restaurants in "X" city and search for matches there? If not, then we should store the city/state in the dish, so when searching for
dishes, all dishes that have been rated in that city with that match will appear, preferably in sorted order.
